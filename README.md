# RESTful-API with Golang

This is the RESTful-API use Golang. With Gin and Gorm technology to make this project more efficient and clean. Also, use S3 bucket to implement the file upload feature in this project.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Directory/Layers

- **cmd**: handle the arguments in the command line. In this case, to handle --migrate and --seed for the database

- **internal/config**: setup the project needed. In this case, to setup the database and all the requirements for the project to go upüÜô.

- **internal/dto**: Contains data transfer objects that define how data is structured when transferred between layers or exposed through APIs.

- **internal/handlers**: Handles HTTP requests and responses, acting as the entry point for the API.

- **internal/middleware**: Provides reusable logic executed before or after the main route handlers to handle cross-cutting concerns. Also handle the cors problem if exist.

- **internal/migration**: Handles database migration and seeding operations to initialize or populate the database.

- **internal/models**: Represents the database structure and defines ORM mappings.

- **internal/pkg**: Contains reusable utility functions and helper modules that are independent of the main application logic.

- **internal/repository**: Handles database queries and abstracts data access logic.

- **internal/router**: Defines and registers routes for the API.

- **internal/service**: Implements business logic and orchestrates interactions between repositories and handlers.

## üåü Features

- Authentication use JWT
- Authorization
- Uploading use AWS S3

This project implements authentication with user registration and login functionalities. It also includes authorization, restricting access to certain endpoints based on user roles, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data. Additionally, users have the ability to upload a profile picture to personalize their accounts. 

## Prerequisite üß∞

- Golang installed (im using v1.23.4)
- PostgreSQL (im using v16.4 server)
- AWS Knowledge and Account

for the AWS S3 Setup, you can refer to this [blog](https://medium.com/geekculture/go-cafe-creating-and-adding-files-to-aws-s3-using-golang-b92eaa5f2081) 


## üöÄ How To Use

Simple, understandable installation instruction, go to your terminal and paste this!

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paundraP/RESTful-API-with-Golang.git
```

2. Go to the project folder

```bash 
cd RESTful-API-with-Golang
```

3. Install package dependency for this project

```bash
go mod tidy
```

4. Copy the .env.example to .env and configure with your credentials

```bash
DBHOST=
DBUSER=
DBPASSWORD=
DBNAME=
DBPORT=

JWT_SECRET=

bucket=
AWS_REGION=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_SECRET_KEY=
```

- If you dont configure the posgresql before, open the postgresql you installed before.

```bash
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE name_of_db;
\c name_of_db
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
\q
```

5. To add the table and seed them, run this

```bash 
go run main.go --migrate --migrate
```

or if you just want to run the program (dont forget to migrate the table first)
```bash
